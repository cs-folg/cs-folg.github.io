    <p style = background-color:DarkSlateBlue;>In my third semester at UCF, I was tasked with creating a a Java project in my Object Oriented Programming class.
        The project was to create a system of menus that a user could interact with that modifies a College database. 
        The options would allow you to add, remove and view students, professors, and courses. 
        The project took the course of the semester and was done by myself and a group of three other students. Using Discord, 
        we communicated the timeline of tasks to be done and divided the work equally.
