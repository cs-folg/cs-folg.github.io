  <h2>Biography</h2>
  <div>
    <img src="Professional_picture.jpeg" alt="Professional Photoshoot">
    <p>
      My name is Caio Folger and I was born and raised in Florida. I began my IT and cybersecurity journey with a simple curiosity in high school, but that curiosity was quickly replaced by passion as I began my undergraduate degree at the University of Central Florida. I majored in Information Technology with a SCAN (Secure Computing and Networks) minor, and while the coursework has been difficult, I have achieved a solid GPA. This has combined with my work as a data science research assistant, which was a remote position that taught me cornerstones of machine learning and AI models.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am most interested in pursuing cybersecurity roles, but any job in the IT field appeals to me as my biggest goal is to learn more about the systems and technology that will define humanity's future.
